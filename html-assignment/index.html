    <p1>My name is Joseline and I would like to welcome you all to my self introductory page. 
        <br>I'm from the <strong>Republic of Congo</strong> (Central Africa), where I was born and raised. After secondary school, I relocated to <strong>Ghana</strong> (West Africa) to study English as second language and pursue my undergrad. I successfully obtained my bachelor's degree in Banking and Finance.

    <p2>I'm married to the love of my life, an amazing man who loves and adores me. We've been together for 10 years, married for 3 years and praying for eternity together just like it is said: <blockquote>True love stories never have endings -<cite>Richard Bach</cite></blockquote> . </p2>

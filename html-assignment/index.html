       <p>My name is Joseline and I would like to welcome you all to my self introduction page. <br>I'm from the <strong>Republic of Congo</strong> (Central Africa), where I was born and raised. After secondary school, I relocated to <strong>Ghana</strong> (West Africa) to study English as second language and pursue my undergrad. I successfully obtained my <abbr title="Bachelor of Science">BSc</abbr> in Banking and Finance. While in Ghana, I met and married the love of my life, an amazing man who loves and adores me. We've been together for 10 years, married for 3 years and praying for eternity together just like <cite>Richard Bach</cite> said: <q>true love stories never have an ending</q></p> 
       <p>I'm passionate about <em>web and Graphic designs,</em> which is why I chose to study Interactive Media Design. Since the start of this program on January 12<sup>th</sup>, 2026, I have learned a lot and I am eager to develop even more skills. My goal is to work in digital media field and gain experience in web design and branding. I'm motivated and ready to go the extra mile to achieve a great career. This is possible with dedication, determination, perseverance, and the hard work I put in everyday as my favorite motivational quote says: <blockquote>Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out. -<cite>Robert Collier</cite></blockquote></p>

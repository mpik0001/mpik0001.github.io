    <p1>My name is Joseline and I would like to welcome you all to my self introductory page. 
        I'm from the <strong>Republic of Congo</strong> (Central Africa), where I was born and raised. After secondary school, I relocated to <strong>Ghana</strong> (West Africa) to study English as second language and pursue my undergrad. I successfully obtained my bachelor's degree in Banking and Finance.
